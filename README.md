# TOPPE Matlab files and user guide

TOPPE development is being done in a private repo at the U of Michigan fMRI lab; this repo tries to stay up to date with that.

**TODO: add examples** (contact jfnielse@umich.edu if you need something soon!)


## +toppe

Matlab package (namespace) with basic toppe functions such as writemod.m, plotmod.m, playseq.m.

+toppe/+utils/: scripts for loading raw data from P-files, and other scripts.

+toppe/+utils/+spiral/: create stack-of-spirals readout module, and reconstruct with reconSoS.m

+toppe/+utils/+rf/: make slice-selective SLR pulse with makeslr.m


## ./pulseq/

Matlab scripts for converting to/from Pulseq file format. WIP.
